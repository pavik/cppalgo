How to reduce dependencies between source files in order to reduce
compilation time when header files have changed

Inheritance: interface/implementation
class Foo
{
    virtual void method1() = 0;
	virtual void method2() {};
	void method3() {};
};

What does constructor do?
Describe algorithm of virtual function call.
How to call pure virtual function? Write code please.

Pointers, references.

Type cast.

Exceptions handling in constructors and destructors.

When temporary objects appears? (implicit conversions, return statement, exceptions).
Temporary objects overhead when throwing exceptions: by value, by reference, by pointer.

Deffered/lazy evaluations.
Consider example, which algorithm will effective here:
template<class Numerical>
NumberCollerction
{
public:
    Numerical min() const;
    Numerical max() const;
    Numerical avg() const;
};
